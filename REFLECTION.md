# Reflection

During this project I learned:

- How to structure frontend and backend folders properly
- How to connect frontend with backend APIs
- How to handle project setup using npm and Vite
- How to push code to GitHub repository
- How to manage commits and maintain project structure

Challenges Faced:

- Understanding proper folder structure (/frontend and /backend)
- Fixing server and routing errors
- Managing Git commands and repository updates

Solutions:

- Followed proper project structure guidelines
- Debugged backend routes and tested APIs using browser/Postman
- Practiced Git commands like add, commit, and push

Overall, this project improved my full stack development skills and increased my confidence in handling real-world project structure and GitHub submissions.
